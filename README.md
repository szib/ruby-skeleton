# Skeleton for Ruby projects

Based on [Zed A. Shaw: Learn Ruby the Hard way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex46.html)

# Usage

1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename (move) the lib/NAME.rb file and lib/NAME/ directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
3. Edit your Gemspec to have all the information for your project.
4. Rename tests/test_NAME.rb to also have your module name.
5. Double check it's all working by using ruby tests/test_yourproject.rb again.
6. Start coding.
